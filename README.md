# PredictO
Aiding health management and disease prediction.
PredictO is a healthcare application that uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is diabetic or not.

WHY is it unique and different from other diabetes prediction models -
It uses only the information from the user which he/she is able to fill in real-time. Also, this application is integrated with an IOT device
responsible for measuring real-time blood glucose levels. PredictO evaluates the data and returns not only the prediction but also a good suggestion
on how to keep up a good fitness for every individual.

Integrated with ChatGPT it is leveraged with technology and AI to help every individual to take care of his/her health.
Keep your health monitored with PredictO.üòä

# Model Description

We used SVM(Support Vector Machine) machine-learning algorithm on the dataset that was uploaded to the repository (diabetesv2.0).
This dataset contains a minimum number of parameters that are required to do predictions for diabetes.

SVM works well for us and the dataset and helps us with an accuracy of approximately: 77.27%

Here are some performance metrics for our model:

SVM Accuracy: 0.7727272727272727
SVM Precision: 0.7272727272727273
SVM Recall: 0.5818181818181818
SVM F1 Score: 0.6464646464646464
