# PredictO

Aiding health management and disease prediction. PredictO is a healthcare application that uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is diabetic or not.

## WHY is it unique and different from other diabetes prediction models ?

- It uses only the information from the user which he/she can fill in real-time.
- This application is integrated with an IOT device responsible for measuring real-time blood glucose levels.
- PredictO evaluates the data and returns not only the prediction but also a good suggestion on how to keep up a good fitness for every individual.

Chat-GPT is already integrated in the dashboard to help user with further insights regarding results.üòä

# Model Description

We used SVM(Support Vector Machine) machine-learning algorithm on the dataset that was uploaded to the repository (diabetesv2.0).
This dataset contains a minimum number of parameters that are required to do predictions for diabetes.

### The used machine learning model in this project is SVM at **77.27%** accuracy.

Here are some performance metrics for our model:

- SVM Accuracy: 0.7727272727272727

- SVM Precision: 0.7272727272727273

- SVM Recall: 0.5818181818181818

- SVM F1 Score: 0.6464646464646464
