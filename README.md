# PredictO
Aiding health management and disease prediction.
PredictO is a healthcare application which uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is diabetic or not.

WHY is it unique and different from other diabetes prediction models -
It uses only the information from the user which he/she is able to fill in real-time. Also, this application is integrated with an IOT device
responsible for measuring real-time blood glucose levels. PredictO evaluates the data and returns not only the prediction but also a good suggestion
on how to keep up a good fitness for every individual.

Integrated with ChatGPT it is leveraged with technology and AI to help every individual to take care of his/her health.
Keep your health monitored with PredictO.üòä
